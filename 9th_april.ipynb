    "-> Bayes theorem is a theorem is probability that is used to find the probability in a particular scenario.for example if there are 3 red ball and 2 white balls in bag 1 , and 4 red balls and 1 white balls in bag 2 , given that red ball is drawn what is the probability that is drawn from first bag , in such scenario we use Bayes theorem. here we find the condition probability/ total probability \n",
