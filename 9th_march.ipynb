    "Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with\n",
    "an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Probability Mass function is a function by which we can find the probability at a given condition for a discrete system and Probability density function is a function by which we find the probability at a give condition for a continuous system \n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Cumulative Density Function is a function such that cdf(x=i)= p(x=0)+p(x=1) .... + p(x=i)\n",
    "\n",
    "cdf is used when we have to find the probability for condition such as p(x<=k), for example what is the probability for a number appering on a fair die to be less than or equal to 4 , so we can find this by using cdf , cdf(x=4) is the answer to this question which is 2/3\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: What are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model?\n",
    "Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Normal distribution can be used in the following distribution :\n",
    "1. marks distribution for the student in a class , marks vs number of strudent \n",
    "2. area of a single bed on which we sleep , area on bed vs area we use \n",
    "3. in a bomb blast the graph for destruction vs region across the bomb blast\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: Explain the importance of Normal Distribution. Give a few real-life examples of Normal\n",
    "Distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "->Normal distribution is improtant because we can use 68-95-99.7 principle for it \n",
    "1. marks distribution for the student in a class , marks vs number of strudent \n",
    "2. area of a single bed on which we sleep , area on bed vs area we use \n",
    "3. in a bomb blast the graph for destruction vs region across the bomb blast\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: What is Bernaulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli\n",
    "Distribution and Binomial Distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Bernoulli distribution is a distribution where the experiment has only two outcomes , success or failure for example , tossing a coin . Binomial distribution is a bernoulli distribution which is performed n times\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Consider a dataset with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. If we assume that the dataset\n",
    "is normally distributed, what is the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater\n",
    "than 60? Use the appropriate formula and show your calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> here z score at 60 is , (60-50)/10 which is 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "now for the region asked , we have , 1- (area due to z score 1 )\n",
    "\n",
    "1-0.84134= 0.15866 \n",
    "\n",
    "therefore the probability of a data to lie in the region greater than 60 is 0.15866\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: Explain uniform Distribution with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "->Uniform distiribution can be used in an experiment where all the outcome has the same probability for example , rolling a die\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8: What is the z score? State the importance of the z score.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Z score is a number obtained from a distribution , after which the distribution obtained from all the z score has a mean =0 and std = 1, becuase of z score we can calculate the area under the curve in a normal distribution \n",
    "\n",
    "Q9: What is Central Limit Theorem? State the significance of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Central Limit Theorem states that for any distribution if we take a suffiecently large dataset , and take the mean of all the group of data , than the distirubution that we will get will be a normal distiribution , note that the size of the sample data should be greater than or equal to 30 if the distribution given is not already a normal distribution .Also if the distribution is already normal than the mean of the sample distribution and the normal distribution is same , and std of sample distribution = (std of population distribution)/square_root(size of the sample population)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10: State the assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> If the distribution is not already a normal distribution than the size of the sample dataset should be greater than or equal to 30 "
