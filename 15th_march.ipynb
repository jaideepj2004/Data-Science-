    "1) Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "2) Machine Learning\n",
    "3) Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "-> 1. Artificial Intelligence :- it is an area of computer science where the machine's get an \n",
    "ability to think like human and make decision. eg : recomendation system\n",
    "2. Machine learning :- it a subset of artificial intellgence and it consist of statistical model \n",
    "which a machine can use by which it can make decision eg :- self driven car\n",
    "3. Deep learning :- it is a subset of machine learning becuase of Deep learning the machine get \n",
    "the intelligence like human where it can not only make decision but also learn new things \n",
    "eg : chat bot like chat gpt\n",

    "Q2- What is supervised learning? List some examples of supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> In supervised learning the outputs of a model are predecided for example :-  movie \n",

    "Q4- What is the difference between AI, ML, DL, and DS?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> AI is the unversal set which contains ML and DL , DL is a subset of ML and DS has majority \n",
    "of AI but in that we also need knowledge of domain in which we are working .\n",

    "Data Science : it includes some part from ml , dl and ai and it also required the knowledge of \n",
    "domain in which we are working. it used to draw meaningful insights from data , for example \n",
    "in recomendation system we collect the data from the user and recomend him the movies accordignly\n",

    "Q5- What are the main differences between supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> in supervised the outputs of the models are fixed and the model is trained to predict that outputs\n",
    "in unsupervised learning the output of the model is not fixed and model is trained to generate the output\n",
    "in semi-supervised learning we have the combination of both the supervised and unsupervised learning \n",
    "\n",
    "Q6- What is train, test and validation split? Explain the importance of each term.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> train and test are the phases of the model where it is created and tested , the dataset use for this phase , \n",
    "is different from the dataset used for validation phase , validation phase is a phase where the \n",
    "model is validated . model only has access to the train and test dataset , but it does not have \n",
    "access to the validaton dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7- How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> consider the example where the material and method to manufacture tyre is given as an input \n",
    "to a unsupervised learning model , and it is train with a dataset that contains all the permutation \n",
    "of the method and material and their output , than under this situation unsupervised learning can be used to \n",
