    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> databases are the structures that are used to stores data , they are also equipped with some function by which thay can work with data , SQL stands for structured query language wheareas NoSQL stands for not only structed query language , sql is used to store data in the form of text and it stored the data in the form of table where the columns of table can be of same or different datatype , Nosql can not only work like sql but it also has some additional features, it can store images,audio,video,etc . example of sql is mysql and for nosql we have mongodb.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> DDL stands for data definition language and it is a subset of sql , it is used to work with data ,eg modify,delete,etc\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE :- it is used to create a new table inside the dataset \n",
    "2. DROP :- drop is used to delete an element,column or table from the dataset\n",
    "3. ALTER :- it is used to uodata the element in the table \n",
    "4. TRUNCATE :- it is used to delete all the element of the table without changing the layout of the table \n",
